# Min Heap Implementation in Python
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Min Heap data structure. The heap supports the following functionalities:

* Building a min heap from an array (build_min_heap)
* Heapifying the heap to maintain the min heap property (heapify)
* Inserting new elements into the heap (insert)
* Removing and returning the root (minimum) element from the heap (pop)
* Generic support for different data types (e.g., integers, floats, custom objects)
The implementation uses bit manipulation for efficient calculation of parent and child indices.
